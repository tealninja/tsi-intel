# TSI Intel — Backlog (Claude-maintained working list)

Claude edits this file (via commits) as work is raised/finished. The
human-readable master snapshot is the Google Doc **"TSI — Notes & Backlog"**
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hwaW6UWV8QG3D8abJVHxex9VrpXnpiP__i5GNtXX8oQ/edit) —
the Drive connector can create/read but not edit in place, so the Doc is
refreshed from this file on request. See `CLAUDE.md`.

## 🚀 Deploy / go-live (blocked on the Cloudflare pipeline)
- [!] Deploy the quote API endpoints (`worker.js` /api/prices, /api/quotes) via
  `feature/db-seed-and-auth`. Patch: `docs/quote-api-for-db-branch.patch`. Flips the
  app from OFFLINE to D1.
- [!] Set the client `TSI_API_KEY` / `X-TSI-Key` so the app authenticates to the worker.
- [!] Deploy `tsi-intel-mcp` (KV namespace, `MCP_LOGIN_PASSWORD`) + add as a claude.ai
  connector. Steps in `mcp/README.md`.
- [x] D1 quotes/quote_lines tables + product_prices seed (31 rows) — live, verified.

## 🧭 Decisions needed
- [?] Price-list PN reconciliation (bare TS-000HP/LP vs catalog TAP/TBP variants).
- [?] MCP prod auth — shared password → Cloudflare Access managed OAuth.
- [?] Unit basis for material samples ($/st vs catalog unit "sample").

## 📋 Backlog / ideas
- [ ] Surface the D1 price-book price inline in the Products tab (shows "TBD" now).
- [ ] Make the Quote Builder "+ Quote" reachable from Products rows.
- [ ] Quote → Pipeline/Deal linkage once deals move to D1.
- [ ] Price Book bulk CSV import/export + price-change audit trail.
- [ ] Proper quote revisioning (R0 → R1) with history.
- [ ] Offline resilience: queue local quote saves, push to D1 on reconnect.

## ✅ Recently done
- [x] Mobile: tab bar collapses to a **hamburger menu** (<768px).
- [x] Products: **family/tree view** (Category → Family → members, collapsible) +
  fixed the sticky column header.
- [x] Quotes tab: list + editable **Price Book** (D1) + **Quote Builder** (Biocarbon
  LLC proposal, QUO-#####-###### numbering, auto-filled prices, custom lines, PDF).
- [x] Loud offline / local-only save warnings.
- [x] `tsi-intel-mcp` remote MCP server (build quotes by chatting with Claude).
